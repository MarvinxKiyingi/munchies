# Munchies

This repository contains the implementation of a web application for Munchies, a restaurant service platform. The app allows users to view a list of restaurants, apply and remove filters from the sidebar or topbar, and see real-time updates to the restaurant list based on selected filters. The application is designed to be responsive, supporting screen widths from 375px to 1440px. The project is built using a tech stack of React, NextJS, and TypeScript, with styling done in TailwindCSS or custom CSS. The backend is connected via an API, and the design is based on Figma specifications for both mobile and desktop views.
